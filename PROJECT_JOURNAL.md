# PROJECT_JOURNAL (quantumleap-imu-engine)

## 2025-09-12
- Scaffolded model (CNN + VQ stub + Transformer) with multi-head outputs.
- Implemented synthetic generator for 5 low-impact exercises with fatigue & placement invariance.
- Trainer implemented; smoke run successful; Core ML export pipeline added.

## 2025-09-12 (later)
- 10k-sample, 10-epoch training completed; exported `.mlpackage`.
- Bundled model into iOS app for on-device testing in Simulator.

## Next
- Scale to 50kâ€“100k samples; 20-epoch job.
- Add training metrics (AUC/F1), best-checkpoint saving, and validation split.
- Improve generator with per-exercise parameters and more form errors.
